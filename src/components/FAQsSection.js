        <h2>DO I NEED TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT?</h2>
        <p>
            Our service functions on a walk-in basis, adhering to a first-come, first-served policy.
            We invite you to visit our shop anytime during our regular business hours. If your vehicle
            is not safe to drive, please reach out to us to arrange a tow-in service, guaranteeing the
            safe transportation of your vehicle to our facility.

        <h2>DO YOU WORK ON VEHICLE WITHOUT AN APPROVAL?</h2>
        <p>
            We refrain from conducting any work, even the most basic inspection, without first obtaining
            approval from the client.
        </p>

        <div className="faq-item">
        <h2>DO YOU REPLACE/REBUILD AN ENGINE OR TRANSMISSION?</h2>
        <p>
            Yes, we do, but only on vehicles that we diagnose first on the premises. Chicago Auto Repair
            will not facilitate engine/transmission replacements without an inspection first conducted on site.

        <div className="faq-item">
        <h2>DO YOU PROVIDE ESTIMATES?</h2>
        <p>
        Yes, we are always ready to provide an estimate for the necessary work. For accurate estimates, especially for repairs and diagnostics, it's essential for us to inspect your vehicle in person. If your vehicle has previously been serviced at our facility, this can aid in the estimation process. Giving an estimate over the phone is difficult. We follow a full transparency policy; after inspecting your vehicle, we will reach out to you for approval BEFORE beginning any work.

        <div className="faq-item">
        <h2>WHAT IS YOUR WARRANTY?</h2>
        <p>
        We offer a comprehensive warranty on all work performed, which spans 2 years or 50,000 miles. Different parts may have their own warranty terms, and each invoice/estimate will include details specific to the warranty coverage. Please note that normal wear items like fluids, brake pads & rotors, tires, and batteries are generally not covered under warranty unless they are found to be defective. However, we will advocate on your behalf, and if a wear item is indeed defective, we will replace it. For non-wear items, should a part fail within the warranty period, we commit to replacing it at no additional cost for parts and labor. It is important to remember that any warranty-related work must be performed at our facility.

        <div className="faq-item">
        <h2>WHAT KIND OF PARTS DO YOU USE, AND CAN I PROVIDE MY OWN PARTS?</h2>
        <p>
        We use exclusively Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and Original Equipment Supplier (OES) parts, obtained directly from dealers, the dealer network, or reputable professional parts suppliers. We do not install customer-provided parts, except in special cases involving unique circumstances, such as parts that are out of production or unavailable. In these instances, or if a customer specifies a particular part, it must meet our strict quality standards. We also consider aftermarket performance upgrades, but only from suppliers we have previously worked with or thoroughly vetted. For further information or specific inquiries, please don't hesitate to contact a member of our team.

        <div className="faq-item">
        <h2>CAN YOU DO MY SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE SUCH AS AN OIL CHANGE?</h2>
        <p>
        Certainly! We are equipped to handle all your essential regular, scheduled, and preventative maintenance needs for your vehicle. While scheduled maintenance is crucial to uphold your warranty, you are not obligated to visit the dealership for these services. The receipt from C.A.R serves as valid proof of the performed service, ensuring your coverage in the event of any manufacturer warranty claim.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div className="faq-item">
        <h2>I WANT TO ENSURE MY CARâ€™S WARRANTY REMAINS VALID, DO REPAIRS NEED TO BE CONDUCTED AT A DEALERSHIP?</h2>
        <p>
        Indeed, vehicle owners and lessees retain the full right to choose an independent repair facility for their vehicle's maintenance and repair needs. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the nation's consumer protection agency, it is unlawful for a dealer to deny warranty coverage solely based on routine maintenance or repairs performed by another service provider. Routine maintenance encompasses tasks such as oil changes, tire rotations, belt replacements, fluid checks and flushes, new brake pads, and inspections. Your freedom of choice in selecting a service provider is protected by these regulations.

        <div className="faq-item">
        <h2>DO YOU SELL USED TIRES?</h2>
        <p>
        As of now, our inventory exclusively comprises new tires, and we do not retail any used tire options. We are dedicated to providing our customers with the highest quality and performance standards, and our commitment to exclusively offering new tires reflects our unwavering dedication to ensuring the safety and satisfaction of our clientele. If you are in need of reliable and pristine tire options, we are here to assist you with a comprehensive selection of brand-new tires for your vehicle.

        <div className="faq-item">
        <h2>HOW MUCH SHOULD AN OIL CHANGE COST?</h2>
        <p>
        Conventional oil changes typically fall within the $40 to $75 range, while synthetic oil changes can vary starting at  $63. Several factors influence the overall cost, including the engine oil capacity, and the specific oil grade mandated by the manufacturer for replacement.
